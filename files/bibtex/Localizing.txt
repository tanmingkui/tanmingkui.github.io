abstract="Segmentation of the optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) from a retinal fundus image plays an important role for glaucoma screening and diagnosis. However, most existing methods only focus on pixel-level representations, and ignore the high level representations. In this work, we consider the high level concept, i.e., objectness constraint, for fundus structure analysis. Specifically, we introduce a deep object detection network to localize OD and OC simultaneously. The end-to-end architecture guarantees to learn more discriminative representations. Moreover, data from a similar domain can further contributes to our algorithm through transfer learning techniques. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art OD and OC segmentation/localization results on ORIGA dataset. Moreover, the proposed method also obtains satisfactory glaucoma screening performance with the calculated vertical cup-to-disc ratio (CDR).",
